It's Festival time and N children are going to everybodyâ€™s home to collect chocolates. They have come to collect chocolate from Charlie now. Charlie is distributing chocolate one-by-one from his chocolate factory to children that have come to visit him in house.

Charlie asks them to stand in a row, selects a range of children from the row and either takes or gives chocolate to each child from that range. The children stand in a row with index number i where index i represents ith student(1<=i<=N). The children already have some chocolates A[i] with them that they have collected from other houses. Pintu, who is the selfish partner of Charlie, wants to know which child has got the maximum number of chocolates.

So, you will be given Q queries of 2 types:

C l r v: where c is a character; l and r represent the range in which Charlie changes the number of chocolates by taking or giving v chocolates(v is negative if he takes chocolates) from/to children.

H: here h is a character representing that Harry wants to know the maximum number of chocolates a child has. In the query of type 2, you have to output the highest number of chocolates a child has.

Each query happens one after other i.e. successively. So for the query of type 2, you have to answer as per the number of chocolates present at that instance. Note: It is possible that some child might have a negative number of chocolates at any instant.(Consider him in debt.)

Input Format

In the first line, you will be given two numbers N and Q representing the number of children and the number of queries. In the second line, you will be given an array A of size N, representing the number of chocolates the children already have. You will be given Q queries of two types as explained above in the next Q lines.

Constraints

 <=N<= 

 <=Q<= 

 <= A[i] <= 

|v| <= 

It is guaranteed that the number of queries of type H will be less than N and such that overall sum of queries does not exceed 10^6.(Type H queries would be much less than type C queries).

SUBTASKS:

Subtask 1:(30 Points)

 <=N<= 

 <=Q<= 

Subtask 2:(70 Points)

Original constraints.

Output Format

When a query of type H occurs, print the maximum number of chocolates a child has.

5th index has value 2 -> (5 - 3) after 3 queries, so type-H query returns value 2.
