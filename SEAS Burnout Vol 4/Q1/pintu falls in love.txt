Pintu being typical Pintu has fallen in love again. To please her, he decides to gift his love interest a string. To do so, he purchases a string of alphabets. The string consists of lower case Latin English alphabet characters and has size N. The string thus has some vowels and some consonants. But the vowels and consonants are jumbled in the string.

Pintu does not like to gift her a jumbled string and decides to make a ‘gift string’ from the original string.

So he starts from the first character and one by one puts each character in vowels group or consonant group. At last, he wishes to make a string from those two groups with alternating vowels and consonants. If anyone of those groups becomes empty first, he simply appends the rest of the characters of the other group to the end of the final string.

Pintu being dumb,does not know how long his final string will be that he can gift. Help him find the length of the final gift string.

Note: A vowel is a character from ‘a’, ‘e’, ‘i’,’ ‘o’ or ‘u’.
